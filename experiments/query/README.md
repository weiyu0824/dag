# Query Experiment
## Goal
Check if similar query has trasferability. 

Patameter in this Experiment:
- D: dataset
- Q: query
- P: placement/machine
- C: query configuration (Knobs)

Evaluation:
- A: accuracy
- L: latency


## Experiments 1 (Trasferability on Dataset)
Experiment: Given 2 Dataset, same Query. Could we get similar Accuracy & Latency under same Knob & same Placement. 

- What is 2 Different dataset?
    1. Temporal Different: Same video, different segment. 
    2. Spatial Differnent: Different video. 
- What is similar Accuracy & Latency? 

### Experiment Setting:

### How to reproduce experiment

## Experiments 2 (Transferability on Placement)
Experiment: Given 2 different placement, same Dataset, same Query, could we get similar Accuracy & Latency under similar placement.
